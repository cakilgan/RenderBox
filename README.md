# RenderBox [ ]

i made this project for utils for creating fast OpenGL projects.


# Libraries

this project uses glm,glfw and glad.

# Building

first you have to install glm glfw and glad as cmake directories (you can find it on official websites of libraries)

and you are ready to go, just build project with cmake.

# Extra

this project made with visual studio, so it should be fully compatible with it.

i recommend you to use visual studio for easier build.
